      <h2>Humble Beginnings (2005–2006)</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Two brothers—my father and his brother—founded AH Packages as a trading business, supplying reliable corrugated boxes to local businesses. Without a factory of their own, they mastered quality control, timely delivery, and service by working closely with manufacturing units and customers. This foundation revealed what customers truly value in a packaging partner.</p>

      <h2>Building Our Foundation, Piece by Piece</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The goal was always control over quality and customization. Step by step, we invested in machinery—corrugation, printing, die‑cutting—moving from traders to true manufacturers. Each machine was a hard‑won investment and a commitment to better products and service.</p>

          <h3>Corrugation Capability</h3>

      <h2>The Realization of a Dream</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Years of dedication and reinvestment led to our own factory unit, bringing the full production roadmap under one roof—from raw materials to the final box. This enabled the strict cost‑effective and high‑quality standards we uphold today.</p>
        <p>We’ve grown from two brothers trading boxes into a comprehensive, modern manufacturing unit—guided by humility, reliability, and respect for our customers and our people.</p>
