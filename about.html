      <h2>AH Packages Humble Beginnings (2005–2006)</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Two brothers—my father and his brother—founded AH Packages as a trading business, supplying reliable corrugated boxes, cardboard boxes, and shipping boxes to local businesses. Without a factory of their own, AH Packages mastered quality control, timely delivery, and service by working closely with manufacturing units and customers. This foundation revealed what customers truly value in a packaging supplier, and AH Packages built its reputation on delivering affordable custom packaging and bulk corrugated boxes.</p>

      <h2>AH Packages: Building Our Foundation, Piece by Piece</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The goal was always control over quality and customization. Step by step, AH Packages invested in machinery—corrugation, printing, die‑cutting—moving from traders to true manufacturers of custom corrugated boxes, die-cut boxes, and custom printed boxes. Each machine was a hard‑won investment and a commitment to better products and service for AH Packages customers seeking wholesale corrugated boxes and custom packaging solutions.</p>

      <h2>AH Packages: The Realization of a Dream</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Years of dedication and reinvestment led to AH Packages own factory unit, bringing the full production roadmap under one roof—from raw materials to the final custom corrugated boxes, shipping boxes, and cardboard boxes. This enabled the strict cost‑effective and high‑quality standards AH Packages upholds today for wholesale corrugated boxes and bulk corrugated boxes.</p>
